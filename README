New tab redirection for Chrome, except it works as you'd expect even for file:// URI.

Clone/download repo -> chrome://extensions -> Load unpacked extension (maybe need to be in developer mode I dunno).

Enable local file access in the extension's options if file:// redirection is required. It's a checkbox called "Autoriser l'acc√®s aux URL de fichier" or something like that. Figure it out.
